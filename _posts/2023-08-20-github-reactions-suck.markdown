Constructive feedback is important, but it's slipping through my fingers on
GitHub.

Let me put that in context. Recently, I submitted a pull request to the Luau
repo. The contents don't matter, but it did not initially appear popular because
it got three thumbs-downs;

![Screenshot; GitHub pull request OP comment, with 3 thumbs down reactions](../assets/posts/github-reactions-suck/github-reactions.png)

Of these three thumbs-downers:

- one of them continued on to explain their reservations, so I could address
them and add them into my PR (thanks!)
- one of them only continued to thumbs-up a now-outdated criticism, so was that
their criticism, or did they dislike other things too? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- one of them simply did not provide further explanation at all

This is a useless state of affairs. How am I supposed to act on feedback with no
substance? It may as well be someone just dropping by to unconstructively shit
on your idea. I can't do anything with that.

What I realised is that this is analogous to how games get reviewed and rated on
some marketplaces. It's true that perhaps a thumbs up/thumbs down system would
tell you what some general *sentiment* is, but it cannot tell you anything more
useful about that data, such as what specific criticisms exist, whether the
review was for an older or newer version of the thing, or how opinions change
over time. These game marketplaces often, as a result, provide a different kind
of voting system, usually a 'review' system that makes you leave a comment next
to your vote, and carries other information such as the time of review.

GitHub has that. It's called code review. You can highlight specific passages,
leave comments, start reply chains, resolve conversations - all of this
annotated with timestamps. This is a sane way of giving feedback, and it
certainly beats vague emoji that are about as helpful as a dehumidifier in the
Sinai.

Let's return to that first thumbs-downer. This is exactly what they did after
leaving their reaction - they highlighted a bunch of places, and added some
detailed feedback about their concerns. While in the end we did have some
fundamental disagreements and differences of perspective, that feedback did
measurably improve the comprehensiveness of my pull request, and it didn't make
me feel like shit in the process. It's just good, solid discussion.

Why isn't everyone doing this? Are we so strapped for time that we must convert
our useful feedback into useless, SVG-format gesturing?

I certainly know you won't ever catch me being so penny-wise, pound-foolish with
my feedback again.
