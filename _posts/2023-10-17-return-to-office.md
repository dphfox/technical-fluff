If RTO was about workers, remote work would be a personal or team choice. 

When you are told how you work best, even with the best of intentions, it isn't
about your thoughts or opinions.

Management is not supposed to make ultimatums to workers. Management are
supposed to be in service to workers.

If management are working against workers, are they managing or dictating?

If workers have no input, are their thoughts respected or discarded?

Think about that.
