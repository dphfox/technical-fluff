I'm not a linguist. I don't care. Someone's always going to call me out on this
and I'm tired of wasting mental energy, so let's solve it for the last time.

## If you give a shit about countries

British English uses *maths*. American English uses *math*. Neither wants to
concede because, as countries, we are so far up our own assholes that we have
stupid fruitless debates about who is 'correct', when in reality we knew from
the start we weren't going to accept any answer we didn't come up with.

## If you give a shit about which came first

It's widely understood that *math* came first, in the late 1800s. *Maths* was
first used in British English in the early 1900s. That's right - for once, it
was the English making changes to English.

## What I give a shit about

Neither. It's all petty dumb egotistical nonsense. I don't care who came first
or who came from what country. I care about good answers you can defend without
wanking off some geopolitical power or dismissing the ability to choose more
modern solutions because 'we used to do it differently'.

You could abbreviate it like *hydraulics* - *HYD(R)* (apparently; I've never
done that). I don't personally think many people will understand what a *MAT*
teacher is. I do think potentially that *MATH* would be the sensible
abbreviation under this system though - I think this fits in nicely and would
look neat in tabulated data. However, *math(s)* is arguably a word of its own,
much like *phone* has replaced *smartphone* or *telephone*, so let's explore
how we should treat it within that frame.

I do not think anyone is debating about how to shorten *mathematic-* prefixed
words that do not end in *-s*. It seems pretty clear that, in any context where
you are using *mathematic* or *mathematical*, not only would it flow better in
conversation and writing to omit the *-s*, but it breaks consistency with pretty
much all widely-obeyed abbreviation rules, which makes no sense. The real debate
then, is what should *mathematics* abbreviate to - *math* for consistency with
the other *mathematic-* prefixed words, or *maths* to reflect the presence of
the *-s* suffix?

Let's look to other abbreviated words; *telephone(s)* abbreviates to *phone(s)*,
*advertisement(s)* abbreviates to *ad(s)*, *microchip(s)* abbreviates to
*chip(s)*. More colloquially, *notification(s)* abbreviates to *notif(s)*, at
least when I'm DMing friends and I can't be asked to write that
entire thing out.

There are two interpretations of this. Either;

1. Plural words retain their *-s* suffix when abbreviated, and singular words do
not gain a *-s* suffix when abbreviated.
2. Words written with a *-s* suffix retain the *-s* suffix when abbreviated, and
words without it do not gain it when abbreviated.

Exploring option 1; *mathematics* is pretty much always used as a singular, so
it should never adopt the *-s* suffix assuming that is true. Exploring option 2;
*mathematics* is always written with an *-s* suffix, so it should preserve it.
If you drill down into any person's thought process on which one is which, and
it goes down the path of analysing the words themselves, you probably hear some
form of either argument.

I personally do not think it is valuable to consider the plurality of
*mathematics*, because you basically never talk about plural *mathematics*, and
so making the choice that plurality must be represented in all occurences of the
word seems pretty redundant, arbitrary and useless to me. The second option
requires no contextual knowledge of plural or singular words, as it only deals
with the direct construction of the words themselves, and so is a generally
simpler and cleaner rule for achieving consistency. Small, self-contained rules
that are understandable without requiring knowledge of usage or language details
are always good in my mind; it's what I would want if I were a foreign learner.

Therefore, it's decided in my mind - where *mathematics* is the longform, *maths*
is the most natural shortform, and where *mathematic* is the longform, *math*
is the most natural shortform. Though I'm probably still going to interchange
the two forms because humans weren't designed to be perfect language machines.

I really don't want to care about dumb opinion games like these, but if someone
else decides they care about how I speak or write and I have to deal with their
opinion, now they have some reading material to satisfy their spiritual search
for an answer.
