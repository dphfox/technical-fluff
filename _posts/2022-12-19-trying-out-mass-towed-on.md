I don't like Musk, so in an act of self love, I'm gonna start peeling away from
their birdsite.

I can't leave Twitter fully of course, because Roblox developers don't seem to
be moving over at the moment in any notable numbers. However, a fair number of
accounts I care about *have* moved over in other areas. So my plan is to just
hang out on Mastodon primarily from now on, and dip in to Roblox Twitter / any
other Twitters whenever I need to. I'll also switch over the comments URL for
these posts to live on Mastodon, too.

This is an experiment. Every other time I've used Mastodon it hasn't really
worked out because I haven't built up any social graph for myself. Now that I've
ported over as much of it as I can, maybe it'll be different.

We'll re-evaluate at some point maybe.

Anyway, I'm [@Elttob@tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/@Elttob) - if it works out,
I'll consider maybe hosting my own instance here on elttob.uk, but no promises.
