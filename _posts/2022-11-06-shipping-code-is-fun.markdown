Yesterday I brought this blog online for the first time. Today I've been filling
in CSS holes, fixing bugs and bringing over an old post.

There was an issue on the homepage where Firefox users would see my head appear
a little to the left of where it should have. For Safari users, the entire
subtitle fell down and crashed into the post list. Fun times! It's fixed now.

Porting over my old ['metatables suck'](/2022/10/06/metatables-suck.html) post
gave me a good opportunity to figure out where my CSS was lacking, properly
finish my code block styling, and trial run how longform blog posts look. At the
moment I'm currently running about 100 characters per line - a bit longer than
what's normally recommended, but perhaps that's fine for technical writing.

Either way, I'm loving the ability to be able to finally ship what I want, in
whatever style I want. We'll see what it's like once the honeymoon period is
over.

By the way, you might notice 'Comments' links at the top and bottom of posts. I
currently just plan to link these to Twitter threads where discussions can
happen, but if things change down the line it should be a neat place to put a
dedicated talk page.

Something I want to experiment with down the line is some kind of micro-article
feature - it'd be nice to just be able to push a thought out without having to
write a complete blog post. It'd keep me off Twitter, too, and that can only be
good for my limited focus.
